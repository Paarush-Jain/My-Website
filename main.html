        <p> My favourite hobby is playing video games on my IPad, some games I play are Roblox, Call Of Duty and Minecraft. Most of the time when I come back school or when I come back from playing basketball outside I like to relax while playing on my IPad. I also like playing games with my friends while chatting to them online. Now how do I chat to them while playing? I use a app called discord which lets you text, audio call or even facetime with your friends!</p>
